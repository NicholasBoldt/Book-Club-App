# Features
### Create and Join Clubs
After signing up, users can create a new book club or join an existing one using an invite code from another member.

### Arrange a Meeting
Chaptr clubs are organized around meetings. Each meeting is dedicated to a book or reading and holds meeting time and location details as well as hosting a discussion board for the selected book. This demo allows for one meeting per club; future versions will allow for managing multiple meetings as a club evolves over time.

### Rate Recommend
Rate your reading on a 5-star scale and see how your opinion compares to your club's average rating. Lookup and add books to a shared Club book list by searching Google Books' extensive caatalogue by ISBN or title and author.

### Discuss
Each meeting features a discussion board for users to leave comments, discussion questions, or favourite quotes. Future versions will allow for filtering by comment type.
